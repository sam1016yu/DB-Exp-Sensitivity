/***
    A singly-linked list that is latch-free and RCU-aware.

    Thanks to RCU, readers may freely traverse the list without fear
    of dangling pointers.

    Writers who perform an insert or delete use a wait-free protocol,
    based around the a notion of "live" and "dead" nodes. It is
    forbidden to change the "next" pointer of a dead list node, which
    avoids all sorts of nasty edge cases that could lead to
    double-free errors or memory leaks (e.g. inserting a new node into
    a sublist that has been unlinked during the insert process).

    Insertion is straightforward. The inserting thread traverses the
    list until it finds a suitable insertion point (often head of
    list, which requires no traversal), and then links the new node
    into the list. We maintain the invariant that a newly-inserted
    node cannot have a dead predecessor or dead successor, which may
    necessitate unlinking a dead sub-list as part of the insertion
    process.

    Removing an element is also simple: just flag the node as dead and
    all readers who encounter it from then on will ignore it. To keep
    dead nodes from accumulating, we impose the invariant that a node
    cannot be marked dead if its successor is also dead; if the
    successor is dead, the thread must unlink the dead sublist before
    continuing. If the last node in the list dies (after cleaning up
    dead successors), it must test for and remove the any streak of
    dead nodes (possibly including itself) from the head of the
    list. This ensures that the last node to die always leaves a list
    truly empty. Dead nodes, once unlinked, can be passed to rcu_free
    and will be reclaimed at the next quiescent point; readers unlucky
    enough to land on a dead node can still finish their list
    traversal and will still see any live nodes that succeed the
    deleted node.

    Optionally, a list can be marked as "dead" in order to prevent any
    new insertions. Only an empty list can be killed, however. That
    way, any in-progress inserts will either complete successfully
    (landing in a provably live list), or will fail cleanly (and the
    thread can retry or abort the insertion attempt, as
    appropriate). It is also possible to remove a node and mark the
    list as dead in a single atomic operation (a feature exploited
    internally by RCU).
*/
struct _rcu_slist {
    
    /* The "next" pointer of each list node doubles as a "dead" flag
       for the owning node.

       Deleting a node takes three steps:

       1. Marking the node as "dead" by setting the lowest-order bit
       of the address. List nodes are always word-aligned, so this bit
       is otherwise unused.

       2. Unlinking the node from the list, RCU-style. A dead node may
       still be referenced by readers, so its next pointer must remain
       valid until the next quiescent point. We can, however, update
       the dead node's predecessor to unlink the dead node so arriving
       threads no longer encounter it. We maintain the invariant that
       only a live node may change its successor, to prevent nasty
       edge cases, such as double-free and inserting new nodes into
       dead/unlinked sub lists.

       3. Once a node has been unlinked, it can be marked for deletion
       by the RCU infrastructure. As usual with RCU, the actual
       deletion will occur at the next quiescent point and in-flight
       readers may continue accessing the node until they quiesce.
