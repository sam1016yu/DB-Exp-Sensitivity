/* Allocating a log block is a multi-step process.

   1. Ensure there is sufficient space in the log file for the new
      block. We have to ensure there is always enough log space to
      reclaim at least one segment, or the log could become "wedged"
      (where log reclamation cannot proceed because the log is
      full). Sequence number allocation is not easily undone, so it's
      better to prevent this particular problem than to cure it.
   
   2. Acquire a sequence number by incrementing the log counter. The
      result is almost an LSN, but lacks log segment information.

   3. Identify the block's log segment. Most of the time this is as
      simple as looking up the currently active segment (and verifying
      that it contains the obtained sequence number), but segment
      boundaries complicate things. Due to the way we install new log
      segments, each segment change involves a pattern like the
      following:

      | ... segment i | dead zone | segment i+1 ... |
          |   A   |   B   |   C   |   D   |   E   |

      Block A is the common case discussed already, and does not
      overlap with the segment change. Block B overflows the segment
      and is thus unusable; the owner of that block is responsible to
      "close" the segment by logging a "segment change" record (really
      just a skip record) so that recovery proceeds to the new segment
      rather than truncating the log. Block C lost the race to install
      a new segment, and ended up in the "dead zone" between the two
      segments; that block does not map to any physical location in
      the log and must be discarded. Block D won the race to install
      the new segment, and thus becomes the first block of the new
      segment. Block E lost the segment-change race, but was lucky to
      have a predecessor win. It becomes a valid block in the new
      segment once the dust settles.

   4. Wait for buffer space to become available. A fixed-size buffer
      holds a sliding window of the log, with space for new records
      becoming available as old ones reach disk. Assuming the log
      cannot become wedged, it's just a matter of time until the
      buffer space is ready.

#warning TODO: protocol to prevent log from becoming wedged
    /* ^^^

       In any logging scheme that uses checkpoints to reclaim log
       space, a catch-22 lies in wait for the unwary implementor: the
       checkpoint must be logged, so the log will become permanently
       wedged if we allow it to completely fill. The solution is to
       reserve some amount of log space for an "emergency" checkpoint
       that can reclaim at least one segment and avert disaster. In
       our case, checkpointing doesn't actually let us reclaim space,
       but the segment-recovery protocol we use has the same problem.

       Unfortunately, our single-CAS scheme for acquiring a LSN offset
       means we can't easily detect that the log is almost full until
       after we've already acquired an LSN and made the problem worse.

       The (as yet unimplemented) solution to this quandary is for
       each thread to check whether its newly-acquired block lands in
       a "red zone" near the end of the log capacity. If so, it must
       discard the record, abort, and block until space has been
       reclaimed. The red zone has to be large enough that every
       transaction-executing thread in the system could make a
       maximum-sized request and still leave room for a checkpoint.
     */

#warning TODO: prevent reclamation of uncommitted overflow records
    /* ^^^

       Before the system can reclaim a log segment, it must ensure
       that the segment contains no uncommitted overflow blocks. The
       simplest way is to wait for all in-flight transactions to end,
       if we know write transactions will end reasonably
       soon. Alternatively, we could track the oldest uncommitted LSN
       generated by each transaction (a loose lower bound should
       suffice) and only do the wait if that bound impinges on the
       segment we're trying to reclaim.
