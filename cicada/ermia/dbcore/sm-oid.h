       checkpoint transaction (or the location where the record would
       be if the checkpoint is empty). When this function returns, the
       scan will be positioned at whatever follows the OID checkpoint
       (or invalid, if there are no more records).

       tzwang: above is the orignal interface design. The implementation
       here is to checkpoint the OID arrays to an individual file, whose
       name is in the format of "chd-[chkpt-start-LSN]"; after successfully
       written this file, we use the [chkpt start LSN, chkpt end LSN] pair
       as an empty file's filename to denote this chkpt was successful.
       sm_oid_mgr::create() then accepts the chkpt start LSN to know which
       chkpt file to look for, and recovers from the chkpt file, followed by
       a log scan (if needed). The chkpt files are stored in the log dir.

       The separation of the chkpt from the log reduces interference to
       normal transaction processing during checkpointing; storing the
       chkpt file in a separate file, instead of in the log, reduces the
       amount of data to ship for replication (no need to ship chkpts,
       the backup can have its own chkpts).
