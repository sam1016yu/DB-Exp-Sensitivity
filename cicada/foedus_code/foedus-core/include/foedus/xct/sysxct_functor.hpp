 * Each sysxct inherits this class and overrides the run() method to implement the sysxct.
 * This class is a pure interface. No data nor no pre-defined anything.
 *
 * We initially passed around template functors, but that demands exposing ThreadPimpl to
 * the code that implements individual sysxct. Rather, we now pass around a virtual function.
 * The cost of virtual function invocation should be negligible for each sysxct execution.
 * Well, let's keep an eye.
 *
 * @note Because this wil have vtable, do NOT place this object in shared memory!
 * You shouldn't place this object in any places other than passing around as a param.
