/**
 * @brief Implements an MCS-locking Algorithm.
 * @ingroup XCT
 * @details
 * @par Implementation Types
 * We implemented a few variants of MCS lock algorithm, so this switches the implementation
 * defined below. Individual implementations are defined as individual functions
 * so that we can also test each of them explicitly.
 *
 * @par Implementation Type 1: "Simple" (RW_BLOCK = McsRwSimpleBlock)
 * A combination of our MCSg lock and the original RW-MCS lock.
 * This doesn't nicely support \e cancel, but functionality-wise it works.
 * Cancellable-requests will cause frequent atomic operations in a shared place.
 * Unconditional-requests and try-requests work just fine \b EXCEPT try-reader,
 * which turns out to require doubly-linked list.
 * For this, we have a meta-method to return whether the impl supports try-reader or not.
 *
 * @par Implementation Type 2: "Extended" (RW_BLOCK = McsRwExtendedBlock)
 * A combination of our MCSg lock, the original RW-MCS lock, and cancellable queue lock.
 * This nicely supports \e cancel, allowing local spinning even for cancallable-requests.
 * This also supports parallel async-lock nicely, but comes with complexity and more
 * atomic instructions.
 *
 * @par Lock Mode
 * foedus::xct::McsWwLock supports only exclusive lock (we call it \e ww below).
 * foedus::xct::McsRwLock supports reader and writer (we call it \e rw below).
 * All implementations can handle both types so far.
 *
 * @par Lock Request Types
 * There are 3 lock request types:
 * \li \b Unconditional-lock. Simplest and fastest. When we have no risk of deadlock, this suffices.
 * It always succeds although it might have to wait for long time.
 * \li \b Try-lock. Also simple, but maybe costly \e per-try. It issues one atomic op to a
 * central place to acquire or fail.
 * \li \b Asynchronous-cancellable-lock. More complex. It allows \e come-back-later to
 * check whether it acquired lock or not, and to \e cancel the lock.
 * It must also allow doing this for multiple locks in parallel.
 *
 * @par Writer-Upgrade
 * You might notice that we don't have a so-called \e upgrade method here to convert
 * a read-lock to a write-lock. We don't need it in our architecture.
 * We always release the read-lock first and take a write-lock using a new queue node.
 * In traditional 2PL, this might violate serializability, but we are not using 2PL.
 * Serializability on the record is always guaranteed by the read-verification.
 * Also, writer-upgrade always has a risk of deadlock, even in a single-lock transaction.
 * By getting rid of it, we make the RLL protocol simpler and more flexible.
 *
 * @par References
 * TBD: original MCS paper and RW version.
 * TBD: link to MCSg paper
 *
 * @tparam ADAPTOR A template that implements the McsAdaptorConcept template concept.
 * We explicitly instantiate for all possible ADAPTOR types in cpp.
 * @tparam RW_BLOCK Queue node object for RW-lock.
 * Either \b McsRwSimpleBlock or \b McsRwExtendedBlock.
 * This also defines the implementation.
 * @see foedus::xct::McsAdaptorConcept
