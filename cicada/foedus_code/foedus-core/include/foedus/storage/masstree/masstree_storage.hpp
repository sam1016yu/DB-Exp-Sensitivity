   * @copydoc foedus::storage::StorageManager::track_moved_record()
   * @note Implementation note and limitation
   * Master-tree (masstree) does use moved bit, so this storage implements this method to handle
   * moved record. There are a few design choices worth noting.
   *
   * In the \e new_mpage git branch, we significantly changed the page layout in this package.
   * One purpose was to allow tracking the moved record in \b all circumstances.
   *
   * When the record is moved within the same B-trie layer, it is anyway easy to track down the
   * new location. When the record is moved to next layer, however, we have to know the entire key
   * to track the record. Previous page layout didn't allow it unless we have the
   * write_set. When there is a standalone read-access, we could not track to next layer.
   *
   * The new page layout always leaves the original key of the record in page, thus the issue
   * completely went away. This also simplified concurrency control in this package.
   * See @ref MASS_TERM_REMAINDER.
   *
   * However, this came with the price of wasted space in page.
   * To ameliorate it, we made a few improvements to reduce wasted space.
   *
   * \li First, now we have a flag that says the record is \e initially a next-layer.
   * When this is set, we do not put suffix, thus the price is gone.
   * \li Second, we also added a configuration to aggressively create next-layer to make most
   * high-layer records as initially next-layer. See MasstreeMetadata::min_layer_hint_.
   * \li Third, we also overhauled the way we expand records in page.
   *
   * Thanks to these improvements, we now allow \e more records, not less, in a page.
   * Previously it was 64, but now kBorderPageMaxSlots is 100 for 4kb pages.
