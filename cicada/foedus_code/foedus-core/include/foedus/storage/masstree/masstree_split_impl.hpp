 * When a border page becomes full or close to full, we split the page into two border pages.
 * The new pages are placed as tentative foster twins of the page.
 *
 * This does nothing and returns kErrorCodeOk in the following cases:
 * \li The page turns out to be already split.
 *
 * Locks taken in this sysxct (in order of taking):
 * \li Page-lock of the target page.
 * \li Record-lock of all records in the target page (in canonical order).
 *
 * At least after releasing enclosing user transaction's locks, there is no chance of deadlocks
 * or even any conditional locks. max_retries=2 should be enough in run_nested_sysxct().
