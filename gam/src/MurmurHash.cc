// MurmurHash2, by Austin Appleby

// Note - This code makes a few assumptions about how your machine behaves -

// 1. We can read a 4-byte value from any address without crashing
// 2. sizeof(int) == 4      **Jens: I fixed this by changing 'unsigned int' to 'uint32_t'**

// And it has a few limitations -

// 1. It will not work incrementally.
// 2. It will not produce the same results on little-endian and big-endian
//    machines.

uint32_t MurmurHash2(const void * key, size_t len, uint32_t seed) {
  // 'm' and 'r' are mixing constants generated offline.
  // They're not really 'magic', they just happen to work well.

#define m 0x5bd1e995
#define r 24

  // Initialize the hash to a 'random' value

  uint32_t h = seed ^ len;

  // Mix 4 bytes at a time into the hash

  const unsigned char * data = (const unsigned char *) key;

  while (len >= 4) {
    uint32_t k = *(uint32_t *) data;

    k *= m;
    k ^= k >> r;
    k *= m;

    h *= m;
    h ^= k;

    data += 4;
    len -= 4;
  }

  // Handle the last few bytes of the input array

  switch (len) {
    case 3:
      h ^= data[2] << 16;
    case 2:
      h ^= data[1] << 8;
    case 1:
      h ^= data[0];
      h *= m;
  };

  // Do a few final mixes of the hash to ensure the last few
  // bytes are well-incorporated.

  h ^= h >> 13;
  h *= m;
  h ^= h >> 15;

  return h;
