MICA
====

A fast in-memory key-value store.


Hardware Requirements
---------------------

 * Dual CPU system
 * Intel 10 GbE NICs
 * Note: The current codebase has several assumptions on the hardware configuration of the server and clients.
         It runs ideally on a dual octa-core server with 4 dual-port 10 GbE NICs, and clients with 2 dual-port 10 GbE NICs.


Software Requrements
--------------------

 * linux x86_64 >= 3.2.0
 * gcc >= 4.6.0
 * Python >= 2.7.0
 * Intel DPDK >= 1.5.0
 * bash >= 4.0.0
 * cmake >= 2.6.0
 * Hugepage (2 GiB) support


Executables
-----------

 * build/netbench_server: MICA server in cache mode (use with netbench_client)
 * build/netbench_server_store: MICA server in store mode (use with netbench_client)
 * build/netbench_server_latency: MICA server in cache mode modified for end-to-end latency measurement (use with netbench_client_latency)
 * build/netbench_server_soft_fdir: MICA server in cache mode using software-based request direction (use with netbench_client_soft_fdir)
 * build/netbench_client*: MICA clients
 * build/netbench_analysis: workload analyzer (used for generating preset configurations)
 * build/microbench: a local microbenchmark for MICA in cache mode
 * build/microbench_store: a local microbenchmark for MICA in store mode
 * build/test: a simple feature test program
 * build/load: a load factor experiment


Compiling Executables
---------------------

	# unpack DPDK as "DPDK" to the directory containing mica
	$ cd mica/build
	$ ../scripts/setup_dkdp_env.sh	# this uses sudo
	$ ../configure_all.sh
	$ make


Generating Configuration Files
------------------------------

	# conf_* files determine how MICA uses system resources. build/gen_confs.py generates a preset of configuration files for a 16-core server and 12-core clients
	# in mica
	$ ./run_analysis_for_conf.py	# this uses sudo
	$ ./gen_confs.py


Running a Server
----------------

	# in mica/build
	$ sudo ./netbench_server conf_machines_DATASET_CMODE_0.5 server 0 0 conf_prepopulation_empty
	# DATASET=0,1,2 (used to determine how much memory to allocate); CMODE=EREW,CREW,CRCWS (specifies the data access mode)


Running a Client (e.g., client0)
--------------------------------

	# in mica/build
	$ sudo ./netbench_client conf_machines_DATASET_CMODE_0.5 client0 0 0 conf_workload_DATASET_SKEW_GET_PUT_0.00_1
	# DATASET=0,1,2 (specifies the dataset to use); SKEW=uniform,skewed,single (specifies the workload skew); GET/PUT=0.00,0.50,0.95,1.00 (specifies the read/write ratio)


Running a Local Microbenchmark
------------------------------

	# in mica/build
	$ sudo ./microbench CMODE SKEWNESS 0.5
	# CMODE=EREW,CREW,CRCWS (specifies the data acces mode); SKEWNESS=0(uniform),0.99(skewed),99(single) (specifies the workload skew)
